# CHATBOT-LLMA3


Langchain OpenAI Chat Interface
This repository contains a Streamlit demo showcasing the integration of Langchain with the LLAMA3 API from OpenAI. This interactive tool allows you to query a language model and receive responses based on your input. Below is a guide on how to set up and use this demo.

Getting Started
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add the following variables to the .env file:
makefile
Copy code
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
Run the Demo
Ensure your environment variables are loaded (using load_dotenv() in your script or manually).
Execute the script app.py using Streamlit: streamlit run app.py.
This will launch a local web application.
How to Use
User Interface
Once the Streamlit app is running, you will see a title "Langchain Demo With LLAMA3 API".
There will be a text input field labeled "Search the topic you want".
Query Input
Enter your question or query into the text input field.
Click enter or wait for a moment after typing.
Response
The tool will process your input using the Langchain pipeline.
The output, which is the response generated by the LLAMA3 model, will be displayed below the input field.
Features
Interactive Querying: Input your questions directly into the web interface.
Immediate Responses: Receive responses quickly based on the queries you submit.
Convenient Integration: Demonstrates the seamless integration of Langchain with the LLAMA3 language model.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, ensure your environment variables are correctly set.
Make sure you have installed the required dependencies as specified in requirements.txt.
Additional Notes
This demo is a basic example of how to use Langchain with the LLAMA3 API.
For production use, ensure you follow best practices for securing and managing your API keys and environment variables.
